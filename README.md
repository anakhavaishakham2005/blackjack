# 🃏 Blackjack Game
A simple Blackjack card game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I followed along and built this with the help of Scrimba's JavaScript course, which really made things click for me.It’s all finally making sense now.

Still simple, but it’s mine. And I built it with clarity, not copy-paste. 🛠️💚
